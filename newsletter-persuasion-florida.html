            By <strong>Edmund Bogen</strong> | The Edmund Bogen Team at Douglas Elliman Real Estate<br>
            December 2025
        </div>

        <p class="lead-paragraph">The hardest part of moving to Florida isn't finding the right home. It's getting everyone on board.</p>

        <p>I'm writing this from two perspectives: as a luxury real estate professional at Douglas Elliman who helps clients navigate South Florida relocations daily, and as a St. Andrews Country Club resident who made the move from New York with my own family. That dual lens matters—because the question I hear most often isn't about square footage or HOA fees. It's this:</p>

        <p><em>"How do I get my spouse to agree? And how do I make sure my kids and grandkids actually want to visit?"</em></p>

        <p>These are emotional questions dressed up as logistical ones. And after years of guiding families through this transition, I've learned that the answers lie at the intersection of data and psychology—hard numbers that satisfy the analytical mind, and persuasion strategies that speak to the heart.</p>

        <p>Let's cut through the noise and look at what actually works.</p>

        <h2>The Real Conversation You're Having</h2>

        <p>Here's what most people miss: A relocation decision is never just about geography. It's about identity, security, and belonging. When a spouse says "I'm not sure about Florida," they're rarely objecting to palm trees. They're expressing concerns about:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Leaving established friendships and community</li>
            <li>Fear of the unknown (hurricanes, insurance, "starting over")</li>
            <li>Worry that the move is permanent and irreversible</li>
            <li>Concern about distance from children and grandchildren</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Understanding these underlying concerns—rather than just countering with tax savings—is where successful persuasion begins.</p>

        <div class="quote-callout">
            "A meta-analysis of 30 studies found that couples who use inclusive pronouns—'we,' 'us,' 'our'—experience greater relationship satisfaction and are more likely to reach compromise. Changing 'you and I can work this out' to 'we can work this out' has a measurable impact on a partner's receptiveness."
        </div>

        <p>The research is clear: Frame this as a joint adventure, not a unilateral decision. "Our new chapter" lands differently than "my retirement plan."</p>

        <h2>The Numbers That Matter: Making the Financial Case</h2>

        <p>For the analytically-minded spouse, the financial argument is compelling—but it needs to be presented honestly, including the trade-offs.</p>

        <h3>What You Save</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>No state income tax</strong> in Florida. For high earners, this alone can mean $20,000–$37,500+ in annual savings.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower property tax rates:</strong> Florida's average effective rate is approximately 0.80% vs. New York's 1.73%.</li>
            <li><strong>No estate tax</strong> and generous homestead protections.</li>
            <li><strong>Save Our Homes cap:</strong> Florida law limits annual increases in your primary residence's assessed value to 3% or the CPI—protecting long-term owners from runaway property taxes.</li>
            <li><strong>Corporate savings:</strong> Companies relocating from NYC to Boca Raton save an average of $7.5 million annually in operational costs—a 22.5% reduction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What You Should Know</h3>

        <p>Honesty builds trust. Present the challenges upfront:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Insurance costs:</strong> Property insurance for a $300K home averages $5,409 annually, with flood-zone coverage adding more.</li>
            <li><strong>Property tax increases:</strong> Florida property taxes increased 47.5% from 2019–2024 as values rose.</li>
            <li><strong>Condo considerations:</strong> New reserve requirements mean many associations are issuing large special assessments.</li>
            <li><strong>Domicile requirements:</strong> To legally establish Florida residency and capture tax benefits, you need to spend more than 183 days in the state, obtain a Florida driver's license, register to vote, and file a declaration of domicile.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-callout">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Legal Caution:</strong> A New York Tax Appeals Tribunal ruling held that a couple remained New York domiciled despite owning a Florida home—because they maintained primary ties (home, business, social connections) in New York. Secondary factors like driver's licenses carried little weight. States actively challenge domicile claims, examining home ownership, business involvement, time spent, personal items, and family connections. Work with a tax professional.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Health and Lifestyle Case: Beyond the Numbers</h2>

        <p>Here's where it gets interesting—and where most relocation conversations fall short. The health benefits of Florida living aren't soft talking points. They're measurable.</p>

        <div class="two-column">
            <div class="column-box">
                <h4>Sunshine and Vitamin D</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adults need 600–2,000 IU of vitamin D daily</li>
                    <li>A few minutes of Florida sunlight can meet this requirement</li>
                    <li>Vitamin D deficiency is linked to bone loss, fatigue, and depression</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Outdoor time reduces cortisol and blood pressure</li>
                    <li>Natural light regulates circadian rhythms and improves sleep</li>
                    <li>Warm climates increase serotonin production</li>
                    <li>Coastal living reduces seasonal affective disorder</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>The research on "blue space"—living near water—is particularly compelling. Studies show that people living on the coast report fewer depression symptoms, and older adults with access to water use fewer antidepressants. Ocean sounds and water activities reduce cortisol levels and encourage full-body exercise.</p>

        <p>When I made the move from New York, I didn't anticipate how much the daily access to sunshine, golf, and waterfront living would affect my overall well-being. I can play 36 holes on a Tuesday morning and still handle business calls. That's not retirement—that's a better operating system for life.</p>

        <h2>The Remote Work Reality</h2>

        <p>For couples where one or both partners still work, Florida's remote-work infrastructure has matured significantly.</p>

        <div class="stat-box">
            <div class="big-number">700+</div>
            <div class="stat-label">New residents arrive in Florida daily</div>
            <div class="stat-context">Including remote workers, retirees, and young families</div>
        </div>

        <p>Tampa illustrates what's possible: roughly 23% of its workforce telecommutes, supported by 54 coworking spaces, 69 public Wi-Fi hotspots, and average internet speeds approaching 300 Mbps. The state has awarded $708 million in broadband grants, with 85% of funds targeting rural communities.</p>

        <p>Miami, Orlando, and Tampa now rank among the top U.S. cities for digital nomads—driven by entertainment options, coworking density, and year-round travel accessibility.</p>

        <h2>The Safe Plan: Reducing Risk and Building Trust</h2>

        <p>Here's the strategy that converts the most reluctant spouses: <strong>Offer a trial period.</strong></p>

        <p>Research following 206 couples before and after relocation found that relocation stress decreases over time, financial rewards increase, and—importantly—open communication and planning help couples adapt successfully. The key insight: providing a clear plan reduces feelings of being trapped and gives the hesitant spouse a sense of control.</p>

        <div class="green-callout">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>The Trial Year Approach:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin: 0 0 0 20px;">
                <li>Rent for 6–12 months before buying to explore neighborhoods and evaluate lifestyle fit</li>
                <li>Maintain your northern residence initially (dual residency)</li>
                <li>Commit to regular visits back to see friends and family</li>
                <li>Set a decision point: "We'll evaluate together after one year"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>This isn't about hedging your commitment—it's about demonstrating that you value your partner's concerns and that this is a shared decision with an exit ramp if needed.</p>

        <h2>Making Grandchildren Want to Visit: The Multigenerational Strategy</h2>

        <p>Now for the second question: How do you make your Florida home the place your kids and grandkids actually want to visit?</p>

        <p>The data here is remarkable. The 2025 U.S. Family Travel Survey found:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>71%</strong> of grandparents took a multigenerational trip in the past three years</li>
            <li><strong>44%</strong> plan to take one in the next three years</li>
            <li><strong>60%</strong> of grandparents share costs; <strong>37%</strong> pay for the entire trip</li>
            <li><strong>57%</strong> of travelers want to establish new family traditions with grandparents</li>
            <li><strong>45%</strong> of Baby Boomers would rather fund a big family trip than leave an inheritance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Beach vacations are the most popular multigenerational trips (54%), followed by visiting family and theme parks. The opportunity is clear: Florida is already where families want to gather.</p>

        <div class="quote-callout">
            "Surveys show that children are increasingly co-planners of family vacations. Giving grandchildren a voice in choosing activities—asking what they want to do when they visit—builds anticipation and makes your home their destination of choice."
        </div>

        <h2>The St. Andrews Advantage: What Makes Kids Want to Come Back</h2>

        <p>Here's where my perspective as a St. Andrews resident matters. The club has invested heavily in amenities that appeal to every generation—and it shows in how often members' families visit.</p>

        <h3>St. Andrews Country Club Recreation & Aquatic Center</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zero-entry activity pool</strong> with bubblers and pop jets for little ones</li>
            <li><strong>Air-conditioned game room</strong> with video games, ping-pong, billiards, air hockey</li>
            <li><strong>Covered playground</strong> and full-size basketball court</li>
            <li><strong>Aaron Krickstein Junior Tennis Program</strong> and junior golf clinics</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Kids' Club events:</strong> Halloween carnivals, mini-Olympics, movie nights, cooking classes, laser tag, character brunches, and more</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Similar programming exists at clubs throughout Palm Beach County:</p>

        <div class="amenity-grid">
            <div class="amenity-card">
                <h4>Woodfield Country Club</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>3,000 sq ft Children's Clubhouse</li>
                    <li>Teen Game Room + Kids Korner playroom</li>
                    <li>Three playgrounds</li>
                    <li>Onsite babysitting (6 months–7 years)</li>
                    <li>Winter, spring, and summer camps</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="amenity-card">
                <h4>Shadow Wood Country Club</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>First private indoor pickleball facility in the area</li>
                    <li>Six climate-controlled courts</li>
                    <li>Eight Har-Tru tennis courts</li>
                    <li>Three bocce courts</li>
                    <li>Active social calendar</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>The point isn't to overwhelm grandchildren with activities—it's to ensure they never say "there's nothing to do at Grandma and Grandpa's." Between pools, game rooms, golf carts, tennis clinics, and year-round sunshine, Florida competes effectively with anywhere else they might spend their vacation time.</p>

        <h2>The Psychology of Persuasion: What Actually Works</h2>

        <p>Let me share the evidence-based strategies that help couples reach alignment on major decisions like relocation.</p>

        <h3>Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence</h3>

        <p>Psychologist Robert Cialdini identified six universal principles that drive human decision-making. Here's how they apply:</p>

        <div class="principle-card">
            <h4>1. Reciprocation</h4>
            <p>People feel obliged to give back to those who first give to them. Offering your spouse something they value—a commitment to visit family regularly, investing in their hobbies, maintaining friendships up north—triggers reciprocity. Studies show customers greeted with a small gift are 42% more likely to make a purchase.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
            <h4>2. Liking</h4>
            <p>We agree more readily with those we like. Validating your partner's concerns, being positive about the process, and complimenting their thoughtfulness fosters connection. (Waiters who say "good choice" increase tips by 13%.)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
            <h4>3. Social Proof</h4>
            <p>People look to what others like themselves are doing. Share stories of similar couples who relocated and thrived. Mention the growing number of multigenerational travelers. "Restaurant dishes labeled 'most popular' saw sales jump 13–20%."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
            <h4>4. Authority</h4>
            <p>Evidence from credible experts increases trust. Quote financial advisers on tax benefits, cite physicians on health advantages, reference club professionals about lifestyle quality. Stroke patients were 30% more likely to follow exercise regimens when provider credentials were displayed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
            <h4>5. Scarcity</h4>
            <p>People value opportunities that seem limited. Highlighting constrained inventory in desirable communities or limited club memberships creates appropriate urgency. At St. Andrews, we currently have just 12 properties on the market—down from 65 six years ago.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
            <h4>6. Commitment and Consistency</h4>
            <p>Once people commit to a small step, they're more likely to follow through on larger ones. Ask your spouse to agree to a one-month trial stay, or to visit a club together, before discussing a permanent move.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Timing and Delivery</h3>

        <p>When you present the conversation matters as much as what you say. Research on persuasion shows that proposals presented at relaxed moments—after a pleasant dinner, during a Florida visit when the lifestyle is tangible—receive more favorable consideration than those raised during stressful times.</p>

        <p>And remember: only about 7% of communication is verbal. Tone, facial expressions, and body language convey the rest. Maintaining open posture, eye contact, and a calm demeanor signals respect and reduces defensiveness.</p>

        <h2>What This Means for Different Audiences</h2>

        <h3>For Those Trying to Convince a Spouse</h3>

        <p>Lead with lifestyle, not numbers. Describe daily routines—morning sun, golf or pickleball, working remotely with fast internet—before presenting financial data. Offer a trial period. Use inclusive language ("our adventure," "we could try"). Address concerns honestly, including challenges like insurance costs. And consider visiting during different seasons so your partner experiences Florida beyond vacation mode.</p>

        <h3>For Those Wanting Grandchildren to Visit</h3>

        <p>Create an anchor tradition—an annual family week (Presidents' Week, winter break, summer) that becomes non-negotiable family time. Offer to cover flights and coordinate logistics; surveys show grandparents who reduce barriers see more visits. Choose a home or club with age-appropriate amenities. And give grandchildren a voice in planning activities—kids who help plan are more invested in the trip.</p>

        <h3>For Current Florida Residents</h3>

        <p>If you're already here and want family to relocate nearby, the same principles apply. Share your experience authentically. Offer to host trial visits. Introduce them to your community and friends. And be patient—major life decisions take time.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>Getting the people you love to say yes to Florida isn't about winning an argument. It's about building a shared vision.</p>

        <p>The data supports the move: tax savings, health benefits, remote-work infrastructure, and a lifestyle that genuinely improves quality of life. The multigenerational travel trends show that families want to gather—and Florida, with its beaches, theme parks, and club amenities, is where they want to do it.</p>

        <p>But data alone doesn't move hearts. What moves hearts is feeling heard, having concerns addressed honestly, being offered a safe path forward, and believing that this is a decision made together.</p>

        <div class="quote-callout">
            "From my perspective at St. Andrews, watching families reunite at the pool, seeing grandchildren learn tennis from club pros, hosting holiday gatherings in sunshine rather than snow—the return on this investment isn't measured in dollars saved. It's measured in memories made."
        </div>

        <p>The question isn't whether Florida makes sense. For most high-net-worth families, it does. The question is whether you can present that case in a way that honors your partner's concerns, excites your grandchildren's imagination, and creates a future everyone wants to be part of.</p>

        <p>That's the conversation worth having.</p>
