        <h1>How International Demand Is Shaping the South Florida Market in 2026</h1>

        <div class="intro">
            South Florida's real-estate market has been heavily influenced by international buyers for decades. As we head into 2026, the region's role as a preferred destination for foreign capital – especially from Latin America and Canada – remains important, particularly in the condo and luxury segments.
        </div>

        <div class="stat-highlight">
            <h2>49% of New-Construction Condos</h2>
            <p>Nearly half of new-construction condominium purchases in the Miami area are made by international buyers from 70+ countries</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Recent data from industry associations and market reports covering 2023–2025 show that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>International buyers account for a very large share of new-construction condo purchases in the Miami area.</li>
            <li>Their share of overall existing-home sales in Florida is smaller but still significant in dollar volume, with a strong tilt toward cash and high-end properties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This report summarizes what the data from 2024–2025 suggest about international demand and what that likely means for South Florida in 2026.</p>

        <h2>2. Magnitude of International Buying in South Florida</h2>

        <h3>2.1 New-construction and pre-construction condominiums</h3>
        <p>A June 2025 report by MIAMI REALTORS® examined 9,115 units in 37 new-construction condominium projects in the Miami market area over the 18-month period ending June 2025. In that sample:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Global buyers accounted for about 49% of sales</strong>, with domestic buyers making up the remaining 51%.</li>
            <li>Approximately <strong>86% of those international buyers were from Latin America</strong>, with extremely high Latin American shares in certain sub-markets (e.g., Downtown Miami and Coconut Grove).</li>
            <li>A later analysis based on an extended period (about 22 months) reported that international buyers from 70+ countries purchased just over half of new-construction, pre-construction and condo-conversion units in the Miami area.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Important nuance:</strong> These figures apply specifically to new-construction condo projects in the Miami market area, not to all property types or all of South Florida. They show how internationally driven the new-build condo pipeline has become, especially in urban and waterfront sub-markets.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Existing-home market (resales)</h3>
        <p>At the state level, Florida Realtors' 2025 Profile of International Residential Real Estate Activity (covering transactions from August 2024 to July 2025) reports that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>International buyers purchased around <strong>16,400 existing homes in Florida</strong>, about 5% of all existing-home sales in the state during that period.</li>
            <li>The total dollar volume was roughly <strong>$10.4 billion</strong>, significantly higher than the prior year but below the peak levels seen earlier in the decade.</li>
            <li>By share of purchases, top countries included <strong>Canada, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina and the U.K.</strong></li>
            <li>About <strong>60% of international buyers paid all cash</strong>.</li>
            <li>Roughly two-thirds purchased primarily for vacation or rental use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Cash purchases and the luxury segment</h3>
        <p>Multiple data sources and brokerage reports point to unusually high levels of all-cash purchases in South Florida:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Several Florida metros rank among the highest in the U.S. for cash transactions, often in the <strong>40–50% range</strong> of all home sales, compared to a lower national average.</li>
            <li>Industry commentary consistently notes that foreign buyers, along with domestic buyers relocating from higher-priced, high-tax states, frequently pay cash.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because cash buyers are less sensitive to interest-rate movements, this helps explain why luxury and new-construction segments have remained relatively resilient, even during periods of elevated U.S. mortgage rates.</p>

        <h2>3. Drivers of International Demand</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Capital preservation and diversification</h3>
        <p>Interviews, association reports and brokerage commentary consistently highlight political and economic instability in various Latin American countries as a major driver of capital into South Florida. Common themes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Concerns over inflation, currency devaluation and changing tax or regulatory regimes in home countries.</li>
            <li>The desire to diversify assets into U.S. dollars and into a jurisdiction with strong property-rights protections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For many high-net-worth international buyers, South Florida real estate functions as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A store of value</li>
            <li>A plan B / family safety asset</li>
            <li>A yield-producing investment when rented out</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pre-construction condos are especially attractive because they often allow staggered payments over time instead of a single lump-sum purchase.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Value relative to other global cities</h3>
        <p>Global wealth reports (e.g., Knight Frank's annual Wealth Report) frequently rank Miami as less expensive, on a price-per-square-foot basis, than older global hubs such as London, New York or Monaco, while still offering a comparable lifestyle in terms of amenities, culture and connectivity.</p>
        <p>Roughly speaking:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>$1 million typically buys more square footage in prime Miami locations than in many established global "gateway" cities.</li>
            <li>Florida's no state income tax, perceived business-friendly environment and growth in finance/tech add to that value narrative.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Lifestyle and cultural connectivity</h3>
        <p>Lifestyle remains a central driver:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Climate, beaches, entertainment and dining make South Florida a global destination.</li>
            <li>For Latin American buyers, there is cultural familiarity: Spanish-speaking communities, Latin cuisine, and abundant direct flights to major Latin capitals.</li>
            <li>Strong short-term and seasonal rental demand in tourist-heavy areas (Miami Beach, Brickell, downtown Miami, coastal Palm Beach County, etc.) allows many buyers to generate income while still using the property part-time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Impact on Property Types and Sub-markets</h2>

        <h3>4.1 New-construction condominiums</h3>
        <p>The statistics on new-construction condos make clear that international buyers are a core customer base for developers in the Miami area:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In some urban sub-markets (e.g., Downtown Miami, Brickell, Coconut Grove), international buyers represent a very large share of new-construction condo purchases, often dominated by Latin America.</li>
            <li>Developers often design products and payment structures with these buyers in mind:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pre-construction pricing</li>
                    <li>Extended deposit schedules</li>
                    <li>Branded residences with hotel-style services</li>
                    <li>Concierge and multilingual sales teams</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Single-family and ultra-luxury properties</h3>
        <p>In the single-family and ultra-luxury segments (waterfront estates, golf-course homes, trophy properties):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>International buyers are not always the majority, but they are highly influential at the top end of the market, especially in Miami Beach, Coral Gables, certain Fort Lauderdale waterfront neighborhoods, and parts of Palm Beach County.</li>
            <li>Many of these purchases are cash deals and often driven by long-term lifestyle or wealth-preservation motives rather than short-term speculation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3 Investment properties and rentals</h3>
        <p>Florida Realtors data showing that about two-thirds of international buyers purchase primarily for vacation or rental use aligns with what local brokerages observe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strong tourism and business travel underpin demand for short-term and seasonal rentals.</li>
            <li>Higher mortgage rates in recent years have pushed some domestic would-be buyers into renting, which supports long-term rental demand as well.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Broader Market Effects</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Inventory and pricing dynamics</h3>
        <p>The impact of international buyers on overall inventory and pricing depends on the segment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In new-construction condo projects in core Miami sub-markets, foreign demand clearly helps absorb supply and supports pricing, especially in the luxury tier.</li>
            <li>In the broader resale market, international buyers are a small share by unit count (around 5% statewide) but punch above their weight in dollar volume and in specific neighborhoods.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most forecasts from industry economists for 2026 call for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Low- to mid-single-digit annual price growth in Florida (often in the 3–5% range)</li>
            <li>With the expectation that gradually easing mortgage rates will support transaction volumes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Affordability and local residents</h3>
        <p>In prime neighborhoods, sustained demand from high-net-worth international and domestic buyers has contributed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher price levels relative to local incomes</li>
            <li>Concerns about affordability and workforce housing, especially for service workers and young families</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Florida has introduced various initiatives aimed at increasing or incentivizing more attainable housing (for example, programs that offer density bonuses or tax incentives in exchange for including workforce/affordable units).</p>

        <h2>6. Outlook for 2026</h2>
        <p>Based on the data and trends through late 2025, a reasonable outlook for 2026 is:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Continued strength in the luxury and pre-construction segments.</strong> High-net-worth international buyers are likely to remain active in branded residences, waterfront properties and golf-course communities.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving conditions for domestic buyers if mortgage rates ease.</strong> If mortgage rates drift toward the low-6% range, domestic demand could strengthen.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent Latin American presence, plus steady Canadian and European demand.</strong> Given ongoing political and economic uncertainty in parts of Latin America, continued capital flows are expected.</li>
            <li><strong>Growing attention to climate resilience and insurance costs.</strong> Rising insurance premiums and concerns about flooding are pushing buyers to pay closer attention to building standards and location.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Implications for South Florida Stakeholders</h2>

        <p><strong>Developers</strong> should continue offering flexible payment structures, multilingual marketing and services tailored to international buyers.</p>

        <p><strong>Sellers and listing agents</strong> in luxury and high-demand communities should price accurately and market to both domestic and international networks.</p>

        <p><strong>Policy makers</strong> face the challenge of welcoming investment while preserving housing options for local residents and workers.</p>

        <p><strong>International buyers</strong> should seek professional tax and legal guidance on structuring ownership to manage exposure to U.S. estate taxes, FIRPTA and home-country tax rules.</p>

        <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>International demand – especially from Latin America, Canada and Europe – continues to be a major force in specific segments of South Florida's real-estate market:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is central in new-construction condo projects in the Miami area</li>
            <li>It represents a smaller but high-dollar slice of the broader resale market</li>
            <li>It helps support pricing and activity in the luxury and ultra-luxury tiers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Looking into 2026, the most likely scenario is a dynamic but more balanced market, with ongoing strong participation from global buyers, potentially stronger domestic demand if borrowing costs ease, and increasing focus on affordability and climate resilience.</p>
