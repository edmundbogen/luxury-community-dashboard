        </div>

        <p class="lead-paragraph">Boca Raton is at an inflection point.</p>

        <p>For decades, our downtown government campus—centered around City Hall and Memorial Park—has served its purpose quietly and reliably. Now, the city is proposing something far more ambitious: a reimagined, mixed-use "City Center" that blends civic buildings, green space, cultural amenities, and private development into a single, modern downtown hub.</p>

        <p>You may have heard it referred to as <strong>"One Boca."</strong> You may also have strong feelings about it—supportive, skeptical, or somewhere in between. As someone who lives, works, and sells real estate in Boca Raton every day, I believe this project deserves a clear, fact-based discussion about what's actually being proposed, what's changed, and how it could affect residents, taxpayers, and property values long-term.</p>

        <p>Let's break it down.</p>

        <h2>What Is the Downtown Government Campus Redevelopment?</h2>

        <p>At its core, the plan would transform roughly <strong>30 acres of city-owned land</strong> into a modern civic campus paired with a compact, transit-oriented private development near the Brightline station.</p>

        <div class="two-column">
            <div class="column-box">
                <h4>West Side (Public Land)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A new City Hall</li>
                    <li>Combined police and fire-rescue substation (~10,000 sq ft)</li>
                    <li>35,000 sq ft community center with meeting rooms and indoor gym</li>
                    <li>Two new outdoor basketball courts</li>
                    <li>Tennis center with 10 clay courts</li>
                    <li>Major upgrades to Memorial Park including civic lawn, playgrounds, garden walkways</li>
                    <li>Central plaza known as "Banyan Village"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="column-box">
                <h4>East Side (Near Brightline)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>~950 residential units (primarily rentals, some condos)</li>
                    <li>~120,000 sq ft of office space</li>
                    <li>~85,000 sq ft of retail and restaurant space</li>
                    <li>~180-room hotel</li>
                    <li>Private development on 7.8 acres (99-year lease)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Importantly, the historic <strong>Singing Pines Children's Museum</strong>, closed since 2019, would remain on-site under the revised plan—preserved for future restoration rather than relocated or demolished.</p>

        <div class="green-callout">
            <strong>Key Fact:</strong> More than half of the total land—over 15 acres—remains public space, a significant increase compared to earlier versions of the proposal.
        </div>

        <h2>Why Has This Project Been So Controversial?</h2>

        <p>The scale and structure of the deal sparked a strong public response.</p>

        <p>A grassroots movement known as <strong>Save Boca</strong> raised concerns about:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Leasing public land for private use</li>
            <li>Transparency in the approval process</li>
            <li>Long-term control of city-owned assets</li>
            <li>Potential impacts on Memorial Park and other public amenities</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That opposition led to over <strong>7,000 residents signing a petition</strong> calling for voter approval on large land leases. In response, city leadership made substantial changes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The private lease area was reduced by roughly 75%</li>
            <li>Overall development density was cut significantly</li>
            <li>Green space preservation was expanded</li>
            <li>Memorial Park and its banyan trees were explicitly protected</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ultimately, the City Council agreed that <strong>Boca Raton voters will decide.</strong></p>

        <div class="vote-callout">
            <strong>Mark Your Calendar:</strong> A city-wide referendum is scheduled for <strong>March 10, 2026</strong>, which will determine whether the project moves forward.
        </div>

        <h2>The Economic Case: Jobs and Long-Term Activity</h2>

        <p>If approved, the project would represent one of the largest economic investments in Boca Raton's history.</p>

        <table class="economic-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Phase</th>
                <th>Metric</th>
                <th>Impact</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>During Construction</td>
                <td>Construction Jobs</td>
                <td>~5,700</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>During Construction</td>
                <td>Economic Output</td>
                <td>~$1.15 billion</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Once Operational</td>
                <td>Permanent On-Site Jobs</td>
                <td>~1,200</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Once Operational</td>
                <td>Annual Labor Income</td>
                <td>~$91 million</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Once Operational</td>
                <td>Annual Economic Activity</td>
                <td>$250+ million</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Supporters argue this would create a true downtown employment and lifestyle hub, helping Boca remain competitive with cities like West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale—particularly as remote work and transit-oriented living continue to grow.</p>

        <h2>What Does the City Get Financially?</h2>

        <p>From a fiscal standpoint, the structure is designed to reduce taxpayer burden:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Annual ground rent payments over the 99-year lease</li>
            <li>New property tax revenue from private buildings</li>
            <li>Profit-sharing once developers exceed targeted returns</li>
            <li>A 1% transfer fee on future sales</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="stat-callout">
            Over the full term, consultants estimate: <strong>$4.14 billion in gross revenue</strong> to the city (approximately $354 million in today's dollars).
        </div>

        <p>Those funds would help pay for the new City Hall, community center, public safety facilities, and parks—covering more than half of the public construction costs through project-generated revenue.</p>

        <p><strong>In plain English:</strong> the project is designed to largely pay for itself, while still generating long-term surplus revenue for the city.</p>

        <h2>What Could This Mean for Boca Raton Real Estate?</h2>

        <p>This is where my lens as a real estate professional comes in.</p>

        <p>Historically, <strong>transit-oriented development</strong> has had a meaningful impact on property values across South Florida. Areas near Brightline stations in Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, and Miami have seen above-average appreciation compared to surrounding markets.</p>

        <p>With Boca Raton's Brightline station now active, a modern city center could:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Increase demand for nearby residential neighborhoods</li>
            <li>Attract out-of-state buyers and remote professionals</li>
            <li>Support higher long-term property values through improved amenities and walkability</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That said, there are valid considerations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Nearly 1,000 new residential units is meaningful supply</li>
            <li>Construction impacts and traffic must be managed carefully</li>
            <li>Quality of execution matters immensely</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="green-callout">
            <strong>Infrastructure Investment:</strong> The current plan includes nearly <strong>$39 million in mobility and traffic improvements</strong>, including new roadways, roundabouts, bike lanes, and smart traffic systems—an acknowledgment that infrastructure has to keep pace.

        <h2>A Defining Moment for Boca Raton</h2>

        <p>Reasonable people can—and do—disagree on this project.</p>

        <p>What's clear is that One Boca represents a defining decision about the city's future: whether Boca remains primarily suburban in its downtown footprint or evolves into a more modern, mixed-use urban center anchored by public space, culture, and transit.</p>

        <p>As residents, homeowners, and voters, the responsibility now lies with us to understand the facts, weigh the trade-offs, and decide what vision best serves Boca Raton—not just today, but decades from now.</p>

        <div class="warning-callout">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Whatever your position, this is a conversation worth having thoughtfully, openly, and with the long-term health of our community in mind.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-style: italic; color: #666;">If you'd like to discuss how this project—or broader downtown changes—could impact your property value, investment strategy, or future plans in Boca Raton, I'm always happy to talk.</p>
